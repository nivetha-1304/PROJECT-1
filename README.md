# Speech-to-Text for Transcription Services

This project demonstrates a speech-to-text system designed to support transcription services. Built using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the project leverages machine learning and natural language processing tools to convert audio inputs into accurate text transcriptions.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `project_1_Speech_to_Text_for_transcription_services.ipynb`: Main notebook containing code for preprocessing, model usage, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 📌 Features

- Audio file input and preprocessing
- Speech recognition using advanced APIs or models (e.g., Google Speech Recognition, Whisper)
- Real-time or batch transcription
- Text output display and optional export

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- SpeechRecognition / Whisper / Other STT tools
- Librosa / PyDub (for audio processing)
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (for data handling and visualization)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-to-text-transcription.git
